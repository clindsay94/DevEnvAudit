# Note for users:
# tkinter is part of the Python standard library.
# - On Windows, it is typically included with the Python installation.
# - On Linux, if tkinter is not installed by default with your Python,
#   you might need to install it using your system's package manager,
#   e.g., sudo apt-get install python3-tk or sudo yum install python3-tkinter.
# It is not installed via pip.
